# Rush-Wars-0.284
First open-source server emulation for Rush Wars 0.284!


## What implemented:
Game lobby, name changing

## What will be implemented:
Boxes, leaderboard

## P.S YOU MUST TO DO CLIENT YOURSELF!
You need to redirect game to your ip and patch randombytes (Check info in Crypto.py file), additional you can add offline battles (I think with the same way like in BS, patch HomePage::startGame)

Thanks risporce for his crypto from [BSDS V49](https://github.com/risporce/BSDS-V49/blob/main/Classes/Crypto.py)
